# ORM-e-commerce-back-end
## Coding boot camp week 13 challenge

This is a back end application designed for use in the e-commerce sector.The application uses Express.js APIs to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. Starter code was provided for this challenge. The task was to create the models for the database and to create RESTful API routes to interact with the database. As the application is back-end, INSOMNIA is required to test the API routes.
A user of this application is able to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data in the following  models in the database; Categories, Products, and Tags.
This challenge is a consolodation of the Express.js, SQL and Sequelize and MVC skills learned so far. It was relatively easy to adapt the code from this weeks mini-project to complete this challenge.
